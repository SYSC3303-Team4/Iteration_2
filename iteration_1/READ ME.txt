SET UP INSTRUCTIONS:
	
	1.	Load all java files into Eclipse workspace/project
	2.	Build project
	
	RRQ Instructions
	1.	Run Server.java
	2.  Enter true(Verbose) or false(Quite) into console
	3.	Run Client.java*
	4.  Enter help on the client to see instructions
	5.  Enter RRQ FileName Mode, with filename being the file you wish to read.
	6.	View Output in server and client
	7.  Use the x on the top of UI window to exit
	
	WRQ Instructions
	1.	Run Server.java
	2.  Enter true(Verbose) or false(Quite) into console
	3.	Run Client.java*
	4.  Enter help on the client to see instructions
	5.  Enter WRQ Mode
	6.	A File Explorer will appear to select the directory you would like to write to on the server.
	7.	View Output in server and client
	8.  Use the x on the top of UI window to exit


	*Note that both programs must be running concurrently for 
	correct results*

FILE INFORMATION:

ServerThread.java

	Abstract class designed to lay base criteria and behaviors for other
	threads in project.


TFTPCLient.java

	Makes a read or write request to either a TFTPServer or a
	TFTPHost. When read, sends a datagram:RRQ/WRQ, then procedes
	to recieve datagrams:DATA from the server/host. Sends an
	ACK to server after each datagram is received. Writes all
	incoming data to a file.
	Client can also make a write request to the server. It sends
	a packet to the server, and waits for an ACK to be sent in response.
	Loops until all data is sent. Packet specification and type can be
	found in TFTP REFERENCE section of READ ME.
	

TFTPHost.java

	Acts as a server, but allows errors to be simulated and propigated.


TFTPReadThread.java

	Is initialized by the TFTPServer to complete a read request TFTP file transfer with the client. 
	Initially sends data to the request packet port and then waits to receive acknowledgements. Completes 
	the read process by reading data less than the maximum size (512).  
	

TFTPReader.java

	Takes a file and divides it into 512 Byte sections. Links these sections
	together as a linked list. Used to read files and split into 512 Byte long
	byte arrays (as according to the DATA packet type specification for TFTP). 


TFTPServer.java

	Receives requests from client(s). Can perform both read or write requests.
	Write requests entail receiving the request from the client in the form
	of a HEADER packet, acknowlegding said packet (sending an ACK), and then
	alternating between receiving packets/writing said data to a file and
	sending ACKs to the client.
	Can also handle read requestions. Receives HEADER packet from client, procedes
	to read a file and send client DATA packets (512B max data size), waiting
	in between each packet for client to acknowledge (ACK).
	

TFTPWriteThread.java

	Is initialized by the TFTPServer to complete a Write request TFTP file transfer 
	with the client. Initially sends a block zero acknowledgement and waits to receive data. 
	Completes the write process by writing data less than the maximum size (512).  


TFTPWriter.java

	Passed byte array and file name by caller. Creates file name based off of passed 
	info, then writes byte array to file. If the file already exits, defaults to not 
	overwriting.
	
ConsoleUI.java

	Generates GUI. The GUI uses a JTextArea for the output and JTestField for the input. This class 
	is thread safe through internal synchronization.
	
UIFramework.java

	Defines the basic methods a GUI must provide if we choose to implement different GUI types in the future.
